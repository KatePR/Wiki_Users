Wikipedia project for class.


This is a class project based on Wikipedia. The user can type any Wikipedia page or word(assuming it has a Wiki) into the search box and click the search button to search for the page. By doing this, the user can then see the last 10 contributors that had recently contributed to the Wikipedia page and see the time stamps at which the contribution was made.
